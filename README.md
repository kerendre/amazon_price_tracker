This project allows you to track the price of an item on Amazon and receive an email notification when the price drops below a target price. 
The program utilizes the 'beautiful soup' library to scrape data from the Amazon URL of the item. 

To use the program, you must update the personal_setting.py file with your desired item and target price.

Additionally, to use Gmail for email notifications, you must update your Google security settings according to the instructions provided in this link: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en-GB.
